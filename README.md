# Cryptocash Clicker - Hackathon Project

## Overview

Cryptocash is like real cash money but with all the good things from cryptocurrencies. It looks like cash, feels like cash, it even smells like cash but it has a digital soul. It is also the safest way to keep your crypto. There is no serious self-custodial wallet or cold-storage wallet that won't ask you to write down your seed phrase on paper. A seed phrase is basically the private key converted to mnemonics so that you can write it down on paper. Cryptocash is a self-contained wallet in a piece of high-security paper. Both the private key and the public key are printed in the context of this high-security paper with a special handheld printing device called Cryptocash ATM. Cryptocash has the best of all worlds and it will rule the world someday (hopefully)!

Our clicker app is designed to onboard people to our project, make them have fun, and earn our tokens.
